A scheduling workbook that facilitates scheduling for a large team of employees.

Problems this workbook helped solve:
* Scheduling each employee for the correct number of hours while maintaining required levels of reception coverage.
* Tracking PTO requests and their impact on coverage.
* Filling in large blocks of employee schedules while accounting for exceptions such as holidays, pre/post work meetings, etc.
* Generating monthly schedules that employees could print out or view on Sharepoint and Google Drive.
* Tracking FTE against provider schedules and expected call volume.
* Tracking FTE by department / clinic and position.
** Employees were split across the Medical and Dental departments, while Medical employees were split between two clinics. 
** Both departments needed to track FTE used at the reception desk and in the call center.
